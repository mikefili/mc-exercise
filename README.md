MISTAKES:

1) the first mistake was when Bob and Carol switched to Bob;s laptop, started a new feature branch, and did not do a git pull origin master.

2) the next issue is when Alice did not pull from master after the first ACP, but Ted did.

3) additionally, everyone working on their individual branches needs to be sure that they are current with the master before working.

3) the other major issue was when Ted and Carol tried to push to master while Bob and Alice did the same.
